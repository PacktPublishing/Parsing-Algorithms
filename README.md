# Parsing Algorithms

This is a repository from the [Essentials of Parsing](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/parsing-algorithms/) class (aka _Parsing Algorithms_).

As mentioned in the course description, we want our students to understand and implement every piece of detail from the parser themselves, instead of copy-pasting from the final solution.

Therefore, the source code here provides only the overall structure of the project, leaving the missing parts as assignments. The _"Implement here..."_ show specific places which are needed to be completed in order to finalize the fully working parser.

Example:

```js
/**
 * List of variable declarations.
 */
VariableDeclarationList
  : // Implement here...
  ;
```
